# Resonator Optimization

This repository contains resources for a project done on optimizing the geometry of a readout resonator in a transmon qubit

The first is the report titled "Optimizing_Resonator.pdf" which goes into detail of the conditions used to traverse a solution space for the rectangular dimensions of the resonator

The second is the presentation titled "Resonator_Presentation.pptx" which provides more concrete parameters used for the optimization as well as additional benchmarking methods

There are also resources in the repository located in the `src` directory which contains the functions and unit tests constructed to run the optimization
